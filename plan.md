# Plan

- ISA
  - Assembler (optional)
- Microarchitecture
- High level model
- RTL
- Testing
  - Verilog simulator
  - FPGA
- Writeup
- Demo presentation

## ISA

- Make small changes to the ISA to make implementation simpler / more logical commands
- Assembler

## Microarchitecture

- Datapath
- Timing diagrams
- Control FSM

## High level model

- Write in Verilog
- For testing programs and verification
- Not cycle-accurate
- Testbench

## RTL

- Simplest parts first
- Begin with testbench from high-level model
- Synthesize RTL
  - Fix problems that occur

## Testing

- Verilog simulator: Icarus Verilog
- FPGA: Lattice ECP5
- Validation set
  - Test for each command
  - Several test programs that use a combination of commands
  - General programs
    - Multiplication
    - Dot product of two arrays

## Writeup

## Demo presentation
